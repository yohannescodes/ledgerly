# Vibe Coding Workflow

I vibecoded ledgerly, and I never had to write a single line of code. You would be thinking I have all the patience there is in the universe to tolerate AI BS to pull this off in just a single weekend, but I am really sorry to tell you that you're all wrong.

Building this with Codex had been an awesome experience that led me to wish all of us were replaced by AI.

Here is how the workflow went:

I told ChatGPT about my idea of building a net-worth-centered expense tracker app. It had been over 2 years since I started logging my income, expenses, and net worth on a spreadsheet like a caveman. This was the pain point that I needed to address before being addressed by the IRS. I admit that I am the target market for this product.

After brainstorming it with ChatGPT, I prompted it to come up with a comprehensive PRD (Product Requirement Document). This PRD serves as a lighthouse to the thing that I want to build, and it would be an easier source of inspiration for an AI agent to help it effectively do its job.

The PRD is ready. I went on to create a new project in Xcode (this was the closest I came to a traditional software engineering experience) and selected SwiftUI as the framework.

I use Codex CLI for most of my personal projects and mocks, so the next actionable step was to ask it to come up with an implementation guideline based on the PRD I provided it.

The implementation guideline is then used to clarify what we want and how we would achieve it. This will help Codex and me to be on the same page.

You may be wondering how many docs shall be written before the actual coding, and you are not wrong to assume I'm nuts for doing this. Here is our last doc, and from now on, it will be the real engineering. I ask Codex to come up with comprehensive steps or phases of building this, and make sure it understands that we follow these steps to even dare to commit our changes for version controlling purposes.

There is no magic in prompting. The real magic happens in the documentation. The documentation helps us be aware of what things are being done BTS and will also be the central resource for future maintenance and scalability demands.

The actual back-and-forth begins here. We let the AI do its job and help it learn from its mistakes and bugs, meanwhile.

ledgerly will be public on github in a few minutes
